## 1. CoCOD8K

-We propose the first large-scale and challenging CoCOD dataset, termed CoCOD8K, which contains 8,528 high-resolution camouflaged images paired with corresponding binary mask annotations. This work provides a foundation for the CoCOD field and is expected to give a strong boost to growth in the COD community.

   Figure 1  Five image groups are from the proposed CoCOD8K datasets, which are (a) crawling insects, (b) cats, (c) toads, (d) frogfish, and (e) owls, respectively.

    Figure 1: Task relationship. One of the most popular directions in computer vision is generic object detection. 
    Note that generic objects can be either salient or camouflaged; camouflaged objects can be seen as difficult cases of 
    generic objects. Typical generic object detection tasks include semantic segmentation and panoptic 
    segmentation (see Fig. 2 b).
